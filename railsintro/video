Model View Controller, separation of concerns
Client, e.g. a browser like Google Chrome sends request to Server who sends back response
Request/response cycle
Both request and response are strings
First thing a request hits is the router -> config/routes.rb
Four main requests: get, put, post, delete
Rake routes lists all possible paths of the app
Methods inside a controller are called actions
All models in Rails inherit from Active Record::Base  which has all methods like e.g. .all
Calling the .all method will run an SQL query
Active Record will translate that request into Ruby
What comes back from the database is an SQL string that Active Record then turns back into Ruby -> an array of objects
Templates in views, static and dynamic content
Controller passes data from the model to the embedded Ruby in the templates and converts it to HTML
The body of the HTTP response is HTML
