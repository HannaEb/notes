Active Record will perform queries on the database for you and is compatible with most database systems, including MySQL, MariaDB,
PostgreSQL and SQLite.


RETRIEVING OBJECTS FROM THE DATABASE

Active Record provides several finder methods to retrieve objects from the database. Examples are find, include, lock, select, none,
and preload. For a complete list see online.

There are several different ways of retrieving a single object:
find      Retrieves the object corresponding to the specified primary key that matches any supplied options. Can also be used to query
          for multiple objects by passing in an array of primary keys. Will raise an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exception unless a
          matching record is found for all of the supplied primary keys
take      Retrieves a record without any implicit ordering. You can pass in a numerical argument to return up to that number of
          results
first     Finds the first record ordered by primary key. If the default scope contains an order method, first will return the first
          record according to this ordering. Similarly, on a collection that is ordered using order, first will return the first
          record ordered by the specified attribute. You can pass in a numerical argument to return up to that number of results
last      Finds the last record ordered by primary key. If the default scope contains an order method, last will return the last
          record according to this ordering. Similarly, on a collection that is ordered using order, last will return the last record
          ordered by the specified attribute for order. You can pass in a numerical argument to return up to that number of results
find_by   Finds the first record matching some conditions

The methods above return nil if no record is found and no exception will be raised. The bang! versions of the methods above behave
in the same way but will raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound

Rails provides two methods that divide large records into memory-friendly batches from processing. Both methods are intended for use
in the batch processing of a large number of records that wouldn't fit in memory all at one. If you just need to loop over a
thousand records the regular find methods are the preferred option.
find_each           Retrieves a batch of records and then yields each record to the block individually as a model. The process is
                    repeated until all of the records have been processed. To add conditions you can chain other Active Record
                    methods
find_in_batches     Retrieves a batch of records and then yields batches to the block as an array of models.

The find_each method accepts most of the options allowed by the regular find method, except for :order and :limit. Both find_each
and find_in_batches also accept three additional options:
:batch_size     Allows you to specify the number of records to be retrieved in each batch before being passed individually to the
                block
:start          Allows you to configure the first ID of the sequence whenever the lowest ID is not the one you need. By default,
                records are fetched in ascending order of the primary key which must be an integer
:finish         Allows you to configure the last ID of the sequence whenever the highest ID is not the one you need
